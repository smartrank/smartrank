# SmartRank
SmartRank is a robust likelihood ratio software that enables searching of national DNA-databases with complex DNA-profiles. The methodology is optimized to enable searches of (increasingly) voluminous DNA-databases, while keeping the rate of false negative and false positive errors at a minimum. SmartRank enables a more efficient searching of DNA-databases with partial and/or complex profiles. SmartRank should primarily be used as a tool to acquire intelligence data.
