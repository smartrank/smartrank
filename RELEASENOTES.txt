Version 1.0.3
Release date: 2017-05-22
-------------------------
SMARTRANK-205: Added a batch mode to allow automatic processing of search criteria files.
SMARTRANK-210: Improved handling of calculations resulting in positive infinity (i.e. when Pr(E|Hd) = 0).
SMARTRANK-212: Improved performance when reading database from a CSV file.  
SMARTRANK-213: The 5%, 50% and 95% percentiles of a dropout estimation are now reported in the log and the report.
SMARTRANK-217: If the dropout probability for the candidate is set to 0, any specimens requiring dropout to explain the evidence will be skipped.  
SMARTRANK-219: Malformatted records are now excluded from the total record count of a database.
SMARTRANK-220: In the report, added marker lines to the dropout estimation distribution graph for 5%, 50% and 95% quantiles, 
               and to the result distribution graph for the LR Threshold.
SMARTRANK-224: A problem was fixed when exporting profiles. If the target filename already existed, the csv was given an new unique 
               name (samplename-copy-x.csv) but this file was not written correctly. 
SMARTRANK-225: Fixed a problem where dropping a CSV file onto the database tab did not work if the file was dropped on the connection string edit box.
SMARTRANK-226: Filenames for log files and reports will now be truncated if they exceed (by default) 128 characters. This value can be configured through the restrictions file. 
SMARTRANK-228: The batch mode of the application can be configured to run only between a defined start and end time.
SMARTRANK-229: Improved performance when reading specimens from a direct database connection.  
SMARTRANK-234: Fixed a problem that would cause SmartRank to hang during the 'Filling Report' phase of a search.   
SMARTRANK-235: Fixed a problem that would cause a crash if any process tried to display a progress percentage larger than 100.
SMARTRANK-236: The batch mode screen now shows the time at which a particular job was run.
SMARTRANK-237: When configuring a database connection, the user account could become locked when typing in the password field. 
               This has been fixed by deferring all validation until the Connect button is clicked.
SMARTRANK-241: Made the name and location of properties and restrictions files configurable through smartrankProperties and smartrankRestrictions system variables.
			   Add -DsmartrankProperties=<filename> to the command line to set the name of the properties file, and add
			   -DsmartrankRestrictions=<filename> to set the name and location of the restrictions file.
SMARTRANK-243: Enhanced the handling of the specimen query so that statistics can be run over additional fields. If extra fields are specified,
			   statistics over these fields are generated and written to the log and the report. 
SMARTRANK-247: When reading profiles from a database, the log and report will now contain the queries used to obtain the data. 
SMARTRANK-248: The location and name of the logging configuration file can be specified by defining the loggingConfigurationFile system property.
               Add -DloggingConfigurationFile=<filename> to the command line to set the name of the logging configuration file ('./logback.xml' by default) 
SMARTRANK-249: Window title can now be configured in SmartRank.properties.
SMARTRANK-250: Changed the exported report to have a more logical flow and added a line stating the database revision. 
SMARTRANK-251: Now built on Java 8. Earlier versions of Java are no longer supported. 
SMARTRANK-252: Files that start with a binary byte order mark no longer cause an error.
SMARTRANK-253: Shutting down of the Q designation is now disabled, leading to an LR that is closer to the one yielded by LRmixStudio.
SMARTRANK-254: When in batch mode, deletion and renaming of Search Criteria files is now properly detected. 
SMARTRANK-255: When a filename exceeds the configured maximum length, a 0-byte file with the original name is no longer created.
SMARTRANK-256: When batch mode is currently running, the application window can no longer be closed. To close the window and terminate SmartRank, first stop batch processing then close the window.
SMARTRANK-257: When the autoStart parameter is supplied when starting SmartRank, the application will automatically connect to the database and start the batch process.
			     

Version 1.0.2
Release date: 2016-09-16
-------------------------
SMARTRANK-184: Added the ability to load search criteria from a file.
SMARTRANK-185: If search criteria are loaded from a file (see SMARTRANK-184) and the file contains an output folder name, 
               the report is automatically generated and the matching profiles are exported to the specified location.

SMARTRANK-204: Added possibility to limit the number of reported profiles.
SMARTRANK-221: When validating a CSV file, errors and statistics for the last locus of a line were not reported. This is now fixed.

SMARTRANK-49: Fixed a problem where errors in a number of adjacent database records were not always fully reported.
SMARTRANK-51: Validation of the database is now stricter to catch more malformed records (not enough or too many fields). 
SMARTRANK-52: If the time required for an operation exceeds the estimate, the time display now shows the cycling '-' instead of a negative time. 
SMARTRANK-53: If Hd has 0 contributors, or Hp and Hd have an unequal number of contributors, a warning is displayed.
